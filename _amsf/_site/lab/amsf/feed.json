For more info please refer to Installation - Jekyll.\n\nQuick Start\n\n\n  Fork or clone the repo.\n  Install dependencies with Ruby gem bundler and Node.js package manager npm.\n  Run grunt init to initialize your project.\n  Run grunt serve to fire up a local server.\n\n\nSo in short for geeks:\n\n$ git clone git@github.com:sparanoid/almace-scaffolding.git\n$ bundle install &amp;&amp; npm install\n$ grunt init\n$ grunt serve\n\n\n\nDownload\n\nGo to the GitHub repository for downloads, bug reports, and feature requests.\n\nTransfer from Jekyll\n\nYou can simply copy all posts from your old Jekyll setup into _app/_posts, you can also transfer your custom pages into _app/_pages/.\n\nUpgrading\n\nIt will be easy if you’re a casual blogger and keep every core and template file untouched. You can use the following command to update Almace Scaffolding core files:\n\n$ grunt amsf-update\n\n\n\nIt checks the latest Almace Scaffolding build from GitHub and update core files automatically. Please keep in mind that if you changed some of the AMSF core files this action will override the changes you made. So it’s recommended to keep your project under version control, you will be always be able to compare changes for Almace Scaffolding.\n",

He is mentioned twice in the Encyclopaedia Britannica as someone’s teacher. There could be no greater lapse: for two important decades (the 60s and the 70s), Althusser was at the eye of all the important cultural storms. He fathered quite a few of them.\n  This newly-found obscurity forces me to summarize his work before suggesting a few (minor) modifications to it.\n    \n      Society consists of practices: economic, political and ideological.\n        \n          Althusser defines a practice as:\n          “Any process of transformation of a determinate product, affected by a determinate human labour, using determinate means (of production)”\n            \n              The economic practice (the historically specific mode of production) transforms raw materials to finished products using human labour and other means of production, all organized within defined webs of inter-relations. The political practice does the same with social relations as the raw materials. Finally, ideology is the transformation of the way that a subject relates to his real life conditions of existence.\n                \n                  This is a rejection of the mechanistic worldview (replete with bases and superstructures). It is a rejection of the Marxist theorization of ideology. It is a rejection of the Hegelian fascist “social totality”. It is a dynamic, revealing, modern day model.\n                  “The objective internal reference … the system of questions commanding the answers given”\n                \n              \n              Subjects to what? The answer: to the material practices of the ideology. This (the creation of subjects) is done by the acts of “hailing” or “interpellation”. These are acts of attracting attention (hailing) , forcing the individuals to generate meaning (interpretation) and making them participate in the practice.\n                \n                  Subjects to what?

It has costumes, rituals, behaviour patterns, ways of thinking. The State employs Ideological Apparatuses (ISAs) to reproduce ideology through practices and productions: (organized) religion, the education system, the family, (organized) politics, the media, the industries of culture.\n            \n          \n        \n      \n    \n  \n  These theoretical tools were widely used to analyze the Advertising and the film industries.\n\n\n\n  Ordered list\n  Ordered list\n    \n      Ordered list\n        \n          Ordered list\n          Ordered list\n            \n              Ordered list\n                \n                  Ordered list\n                  Ordered list\n                \n              \n              Ordered list\n                \n                  Ordered list\n                \n              \n              Ordered list\n            \n          \n        \n      \n      Ordered list\n        \n          Ordered list\n          Ordered list\n        \n      \n    \n  \n  Ordered list\n\n\n\n\n“This should be replaced.”\n\n“This should be replaced.”\n\nThis is a normal paragraph.\n\n‘This should be replaced.’\n\n‘This should be replaced.’\n\nThis is a normal paragraph.\n\n「This should be replaced.」\n\n「This should be replaced.」\n\nThis is a normal paragraph.\n\n『This should be replaced.』\n\n『This should be replaced.』\n\nThis is a normal paragraph.\n\n（This should be replaced.）\n\n（This should be replaced.）\n\nThis is a normal paragraph.\n\n\n\nMost of these elements are styled by browsers with few modifications on our part.\n\nMaui and his rough as guts piece of pounamu, what a stink buzz.

Though he seemed disinterested, vaguely detached, he had obviously heard of HIV before. His chart from the local clinic indicated a previous history of and treatment for anal gonorrhea, two acute cases of syphilis in the past three years, and a urinary tract infection last month. His only listed sexual contact, his wife. Who, strangely enough, only tested positive for one of the syphilis infections.\n\n“Mistake, this! I am married, not a giver of ass.”\n\nGiver of ass? That’s one for the archive, I think.\n\nUnwilling to engage his obvious denials, I ignore the comment and instead explain that due to a higher than acceptable potential of a false positive result, we won’t consider his oral test as confirmatory until the more accurate blood analysis is in.\n\n“I no understand”, he says to the room in general.\n\nHis annoyance is obvious. Abrasively, he offers me his exposed forearm. This, I assume, is my cue to draw his blood. Ignoring the indignant anger beginning to rise, I tighten my jaw, then swab the fat vein with betadine, working the cool, brown liquid off in concentric circles, using strong medicinal smelling alcohol. I use the betadine, as most of these men work in the mines, and dirt three layers thick on exposed skin is the norm. As the first tube in the vacationer fills with blood, he asks,\n\n“So how I get this thing?”\n\nAh, I see we are going to play the circuitous dance of ignorance. Sounding just a little too clinical, I begin the HIV 101 mantra.\n\n“Well, people acquire HIV through certain types of sex with an infected person, through sharing needles with an infected person, and sometimes through a blood transfusion. Have you ever had a blood transfusion, sir?”\n\nI take the dismissive wave of his hand as a no to the transfusion question. I don’t make a great attempt to navigate a comfort zone here; instinct and experience telling me he has already set the script of what is to follow.\n\n“She is fucking other cocks my whore devil wife”?\nBingo! A narrative that over the next six weeks I will hear from several other men as well.\n\n“These whores, all they want is the cock!”\nCareful Skippy, you really aren’t as convincing as you think you are.\n\n\n  \n    “She is fucking other cocks my whore devil wife”?\n    \n    Bingo!

There’re some factors that prevent it from generating pages:\n\n\n  Many features Almace Scaffolding provides like live reloading, Less support, inline SVG, and HTML minification are implemented using Grunt.js, it’s not supported by GitHub Pages.\n  Almace Scaffolding uses the latest pre-release Jekyll, so not all features are supported by GitHub Pages renderers.\n  GItHub Pages build server overwrites the source settings. This prevent it generating pages from current file structure.\n\n\nThe Solution\n\nI know this can be tricky and more verbose than uploading your Jekyll site directly to your repository. However GitHub Pages support static HTML pages, a workaround solution for using Almace Scaffolding on GitHub Pages is treating your Jekyll site as static pages:\n\n\n  Build your site locally (grunt build).\n  Upload Jekyll generated static files to your username.github.io repository.\n\n\nIf you’d like to keep all things under Git control, you can try the following file structure:\n\n├── _amsf/ (Almace Scaffolding source code)\n├── *.html (Jekyll-generated static pages)\n└── README.md (your own readme)\n\n\n\nYou can see this live demo how to make them friends.\n",
